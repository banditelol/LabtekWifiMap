This is a speedproject series for Labtek Indie Research project. In the spirit of making Labtek Indie's internet coverage better, we set out to map the signal strength across the office.
## Tools Used
### Measurement
Using pencil and paper and tiles to measure the rough size of our office.
### Floorplanning
And using [Google Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/)  for creating a good enough floor plan.
### Heatmapper
